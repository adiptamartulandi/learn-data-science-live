Data science has become a pivotal tool for businesses aiming to leverage data to drive decision-making, improve efficiency, and gain a competitive edge. In this article, we explore how leading companies like Amazon, Youtube, and Others utilize data science to enhance their operations, drive revenue, and customer experiences.

## Amazon

Amazon, one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, leverages data science across various aspects of its business.

### Recommendation System

Amazon uses sophisticated recommendation algorithms to suggest products to customers based on their browsing history, purchase history, and items in their cart. This personalized shopping experience significantly boosts sales and customer satisfaction. According to Mckinsey Report, Amazon Recommendation System drive 35% of its sales.

## Youtube

Given the massive scale of users, activities, and content, YouTube harnesses the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to manage its operations.

### Automated Removal of Inappropriate Content

In the first quarter of 2019, YouTube removed 8.3 million videos, with 76% of them being flagged automatically by AI classifiers. Over 70% of these videos were identified before any user had viewed them. While the algorithms are not flawless, they review content much faster than human monitors could alone. Cecile Frot-Coutaz, YouTube's head of EMEA, stated that the platformâ€™s "number one priority" is to protect its users from harmful content.

## Gojek

GoFood, Gojek's food delivery service, focuses on reducing delivery time to enhance customer satisfaction. Accurate estimation of delivery time (ETA) is crucial for customer trust and conversion rates.

### Estimate Food Debarkation Time with Tensoba

Tensoba is a system that estimates the time between a driver accepting an order and the food's arrival at the customer. The solution involves using both historical data of merchants and order-level features like traffic, distance, and type of food. Tensoba uses one of the Machine Learning model (XGBoost), significantly reduced the ETA calculations error from 31% to 23%.

## Uber

Uber relies on reliable internal systems and accurate data. Minor system glitches that miss to detect can harm user experience and revenue, minor issues can persist and accumulate, leading to poor experiences and financial losses.

### Uber Anomaly Detection & Alerting System

Uber create system with unsupervised learning on multi-dimensional time series data to detects anomalies in various metrics, providing early alerts to prevent disruptions. This system is continuously measures and monitors the performance, adjusting for enhanced accuracy. This system significantly reduces the time taken to detect issues, improving efficiency, reliability, and proactivity, preparing Uber for future challenges.

## Meta

Meta is using statistics and machine learning (ML) to improve Instagram's notification personalization, particularly for daily digest push notifications. Traditionally, click-through rate (CTR) models were used to predict the likelihood of users clicking on notifications. However, CTR models often sent notifications to highly active users who would see the content organically, leading to unnecessary notifications.


### Machine Learning (ML) to improve Instagram's Notification Personalization

Meta combined causal inference and ML to better manage notification sending. By estimating the incremental value of sending notifications, they could target users more effectively. The new method reduced notification volume without decreasing user engagement, enhancing the user experience and conserving resources. Meta continues to apply ML and statistics to improve user notification experiences on Instagram.
